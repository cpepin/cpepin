### Hi, I'm Cam 👋
I'm a software writer based in Boulder, CO, and I love building things with Javascript. I have a degree in computer science from the University of New Hampshire, where I got my start in development building low-level automation scripts for IPv6 protocol testing.

#### I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at Meta  🧳
In the past, I've worked at [Pachyderm](https://www.pachyderm.com/), [PathAI](https://www.pathai.com/) and a couple fortune 500 insurance and finance companies.

#### You can read my thoughts on programming on my blog [here](https://bigono.dev/) 👨‍💻
I post infrequently, but I'm trying to write more often.
