### Hi, I'm Cam 👋
I'm a software writer from NH, USA, and I love building things with Javascript.

#### I'm currently working as a Senior Frontend Engineer @ [Pachyderm](https://www.pachyderm.com/) 🧳
Yup, we're [hiring](https://jobs.lever.co/pachyderm/)!

#### I'm currently working on [Pachyderm Hub](https://hub.pachyderm.com) 🚀
Our techstack is React & Graphql (w/ Apollo).

I post infrequently, but I'm trying to write more often.
