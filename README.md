### Hi, I'm Cam 👋
I'm a software writer from NH, USA, and I love building things with Javascript. I have a degree in computer science from the University of New Hampshire, where I got my start in development building low-level automation scripts for IPv6 protocol testing.

#### I'm currently working as a Senior Frontend Engineer @ [Pachyderm](https://www.pachyderm.com/) 🧳
Yup, we're [hiring](https://boards.greenhouse.io/pachyderm)! In the past, I've worked at [PathAI](https://www.pathai.com/) and a couple big insurance companies.

#### I'm currently working on [Pachyderm Hub](https://hub.pachyderm.com) 🚀
Our techstack is React & Graphql (w/ Apollo).

#### You can read my thoughts on programming on my blog [here](https://bigono.dev/) 👨‍💻
I post infrequently, but I'm trying to write more often.
